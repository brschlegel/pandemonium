# Props
Props are customizable objects that are used to create minigames. These are dev tools, prefabs with lots of variables to tweak to change behaviour. One example could be a prop spawner, a ball, a goal, a death plane, a respawn point. The idea is to create general objects that can be used for multiple mini-games by tweaking a couple numbers. Ideally, minigames could be quickly and easily created using only props, but I imagine that a few custom objects will need to be created.
